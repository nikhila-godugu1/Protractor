1. The gifts dropdown for selecting Gift Card does not populate intermittently.
2. Klarna tab comes up intermittently in checkout page. Since it can't be used when you purchase Gift Card(s), it should not come up for giftcard purchase.
3. While filling the payment details, the date field for card details comes up as textbox sometimes and drop down sometimes, which is not a consistent behavior.

Please find the screenshots for the bugs in the folder.
